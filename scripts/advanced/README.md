# Advanced API Lessons - 10 Level Progression

This directory contains 10 progressive lessons that build on each other, teaching you to work with APIs step by step.

## Learning Path

Each level introduces 1-2 new concepts while building on previous lessons. Complete them in order!

| Level | File | Concepts | Prerequisites |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|
| **1** | `1/@dogApi.js` | Basic API call, dot notation, array mapping | None |
| **2** | `2/@catApi.js` | Nested objects, conditionals | Level 1 |
| **3** | `3/@ghibliApi.js` | Multiple properties, complex templates | Levels 1-2 |
| **4** | `4/@dogApiByName.js` | User input (prompt), string methods | Levels 1-3 |
| **5** | `5/@pokeApi.js` | Multiple API calls, Promise.all() | Levels 1-4 |
| **6** | `6/@pokeApiByName.js` | Complex nested data, calculations | Levels 1-5 |
| **7** | `7/@nutritionApi.js` | Optional chaining (?.), fallbacks | Levels 1-6 |
| **8** | `8/@lyricsApi.js` | Multiple inputs, URL encoding, error handling | Levels 1-7 |
| **9** | `9/@artInstituteApi.js` | Type checking, URL building, advanced Promise.all | Levels 1-8 |
| **10** | `10/@customApi.js` | Multi-API mashups, creative projects | Levels 1-9 |

## How to Use

1. **Start with Level 1** - Open `1/@dogApi.js` in your editor
2. **Read the header comments** - They explain what you'll learn
3. **Complete the TODOs** - Fill in the missing code pieces
4. **Test your work** - Update `index.html` to use the script you're working on
5. **Move to the next level** - Once Level 1 works, start Level 2!

## Concepts You'll Master

- **Level 1-3:** Basic API calls, accessing data, displaying information
- **Level 4:** Getting user input and making dynamic API calls
- **Level 5:** Making multiple API calls efficiently
- **Level 6:** Working with complex nested data structures
- **Level 7:** Safely handling missing or incomplete data
- **Level 8:** Advanced error handling and URL encoding
- **Level 9:** Complex API patterns and data transformation
- **Level 10:** Combining multiple APIs creatively

## Tips

- **Read the comments** - They explain WHY we're doing things, not just what
- **Use the console** - `console.log()` is your friend for debugging
- **Test frequently** - Don't wait until all TODOs are done
- **Ask for help** - If you're stuck, check previous levels for similar patterns

## File Naming

Files with `@` prefix are the lesson templates (what you edit). Complete versions with answers will be in separate branches.

Happy coding! 🚀
